RBY-battlesim is a solution for testing optimal strategies in battles in the original Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow.

In it's current state, it is useful for setting up battle conditions without having to play the game to that point and either playing those battles manually or setting up a rules-based AI to play through.
The main output is win percentage, but it also provides average turn number and time spent if optimizing for time.

It is limited to a single pokemon in battle and no items in battle. It uses pyboy to run the battle so it is as accurate as possible. You must supply your own Red or Yellow rom and put it in the pyboy folder.

RBY-battlesim is still in alpha and may have bugs, quirks, or missing features.
